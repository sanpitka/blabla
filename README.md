#Blabla Communicator

The purpose of the Blabla Communicator is to send direct messages between users, chat in channels and use threads.
Unfortunately, this is not ready yet but only a draft.
Feel free to have a look at it!

In the final version, there would be a possibility to create own channels and join into existing ones and send direct messages to individuals.
This version shows the overview of the platform. There is a text field for adding comments in the bottom of the page. Replying to a comment is possible by clicking the comment one wants to reply.
